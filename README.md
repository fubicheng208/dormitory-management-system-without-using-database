# dormitory-management-system-without-using-database
This is my homework which commands not to use database to make a dormitory management system.

It has the following functions:
1.Create rooms but can't insert a new dormitory.
2.Insert students to a room.
3.Search a student or a room with its ID.
4.Distribute a room for a student.
5.Exchange or change a student's room.
6.Delete students' info.

NOTICE:YOU SHOULD FIRST CREATE A FILE CALLED 'rooms_count.txt' IN THE PROGRAM FOLDER.
